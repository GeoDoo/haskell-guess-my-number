### Guess My Number in Haskell

The rules are rather simple. You are trying to guess a number I set on the terminal. After that each time you give me a number I will tell you if it is higher or lower than my number until you guess it right!

You can start the game by running the following on `gchi`:

```huskell
:l Main.hs
guessmynumber 89
```

The number of course is indicative here. Enjoy!
